# Haste Server

I've always wanted my own instance of the [Haste
server](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server) so that I could freely dump
whatever files I wanted into it without worrying about privacy. This
implementation currently depends on the
[config.js](https://github.com/seejohnrun/haste-server/blob/master/config.js)
that is in the original repository, because I did not want to make major
changes to it. Instead, I will use Kubernetes to update that config in a future
update.
