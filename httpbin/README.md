# Httpbin

This was put in because I wanted to try learning to write my own yaml instead
of using one that someone else wrote. It's a simple Kubernetes deployment
around [httpbin](http://httpbin.org/) by
[@kennethreitz](https://github.com/kennethreitz), along with exposure as
a service and an ingress resource, all tucked safely away in its own namespace.
